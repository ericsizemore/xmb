	<span id="pageTitle">Upgrading to XMB 1.9.10 Karl</span>
	
	Upgrading is a one-way process.  To backout you will need to restore your files and database from a backup.
	<br /><br />
	
	<strong>Backup Your Forum</strong>
	<br />
	Please backup both your forums database and files before continuing.  This may seem like common sense but is often forgotten.
	If the upgrade process fails and you do not have a backup, XMB will be unable to help you.  All data could be lost: posts, users,
	etc.  You have been warned!
	<br /><br />

	<strong>Modifications Notice</strong>
	<br />
	This upgrader is designed to work with modifications installed.  However, all modification data, templates and code, will be destroyed during the
	upgrade process.  Please proceed with extreme caution if you wish to keep your modification data intact.
	<br /><br />
	
	<strong>Known Issues</strong>
	<br />
	These are known issues with the upgrader.  However, they will only affect a small percentage of XMB Forum users.

	<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
		<li>Upgrading can be quite resource intensive, especially with large databases.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script may appear to time out or be inactive.  Do NOT stop it or close your browser window.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script can consume up to two times the amount of disk space you are currently using.
			Make sure your disk space quota is set accordingly.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script occasionally fails to handle out of order columns, particularly in the settings table.
        <li>If the upgrader stops while modifying any table, please contact the support staff at <a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/">XMBForum.com</a>.
            Restore your database and original files from backups if necessary.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Normal Upgrade Instructions</strong>

	<ol style="margin-top: 5px;">

        <li>XMB 1.9.9 - Complete diff & patch information will be provided to anyone who wants to manually edit their PHP files.
        <li>XMB 1.9.8 SP2/SP3 - An alternative upgrade script will be provided to anyone who wants to avoid the normal upgrade utility.

<span id="pageTitle">Welcome to XMB 1.9.8 Engage!</span>

With 1.9.8 Engage you can expect several new features, a more secure
environment due to validation routines, as well as fixes to bugs and
quirks that were previously reported. 1.9.8 Engage is the succesor to
1.9.7 Nexus but is not based on 1.9.7's codebase. To create 1.9.8
Engage, the codebase was rolled back to John Brigg's service pack 1 of
1.9.5.
